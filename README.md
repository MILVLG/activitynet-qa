The ActivityNet-QA dataset contains 58,000 QA pairs on 5,800 complex web videos derived from the popular ActivityNet dataset. The question & answer pairs are collected via human crowdsourcing. The dataset can be used to understand complex web videos via Question Answering techniques. 

In this repository, you can find the [val](val/README.md) and the [dataset](dataset/README.md) for our **AAAI 2019** paper: **ActivityNet-QA: A Dataset for Understanding Complex Web Videos via Question Answering**.
